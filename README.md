# Nashville Crime: Pre-Covid, Covid, & Now
## How has the emergence and continued presence of Covid-19 shaped crime statistics in Nashville-Davidson County?

This is the foundational question for my Capstone Project.  Covid-19 has forced upon humanity an immeasurable paradigm shift; from the way people socially interact, the way business is conducted, how our children attend school, and how we make a living have all been altered.  I want to know how has that shift affected crime?

## My Motivation

Prior to enrolling in the full-time Data Analytics program at Nashville Software School, I served as an officer and detective for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department from October 2009 to July of 2021.  In those nearly 12 years, I responded to thousands of calls for service and conducted hundreds of investigations into all manner of crime.  Also, I learned that crime, in general, followed certain patterns.  For example, when summer arrived and the days and nights were hot, work was going to get busy; by that I mean calls for service would increase and so to would the amount of crime.  Also, when kids were out of school for various breaks, certain crimes were going to spike.  It was just a foregone conclusion.  

With the arrival of the virus, normal life was turned upside down.  Working from home was/is now the norm and via Zoom became the way children attened school. I became curious how crime adapted to the new way of life.  Although I was present for that change, I never looked into the actual numbers to see how crimes evolved.  There were certain assumptions I made, but those were based upon gut feeligns and personal observations, not from diving into the data.  Given that more people are working from home, I assumed that the number of residential burglaries decreased; burglars don't want to encounter people when trying to break into a house.  Also, I assumed that more people working from home caused the number of domestic-related crimes to increase.  With constant interaction between spouses, family members, roommates, etc., it seemed only rational that friction between them would increase since they were not accustomed to being around each other all the time.  With that, I decided to dive into the Nashville-Davidson County crime statistics to see if my assumptions were correct, and what other changes (if any) arose.
